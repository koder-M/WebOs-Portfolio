## 📌 About The Project

WebOS Portfolio is a fully functional MacOS-style desktop environment built entirely using **HTML, SCSS/CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

It simulates a real operating system experience inside the browser — complete with window management, folder system, terminal, camera, photos app, and persistent storage.

This project demonstrates advanced DOM manipulation, UI engineering, and system-level frontend architecture without using any frameworks.
